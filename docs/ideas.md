Team Name: U-Lost

Application Name: UMass Amherst - Lost & Found 

Team Overview: Sahil Joshi (sahiljoshi515), Sidharth Saluja (SidharthSaluja), Nishant Jain (nishant1549), Vikas Balamurgan (vbalamurugan)

Innovative Idea: We are building a web application which will help users find their lost items. There will be two interfaces - 
One for the person who found the lost item (They upload the image of the item, location at which the item was found, etc.)
Other for the person who lost their item (They will be able to see the items uploaded by the founder on the application)
We are unaware of a proper web application specific to UMass Amherst which will do what we are suggesting.

Important Components: There will be 4-5 major components in our webpage.
Login/Register - User can login or register only if they are affiliated to UMass Amherst.
Finder/Reporter - Finder is someone who has lost an item and will select the Finder section. Reporter is someone
who will report the item with image of the item and other details in the Reporter section.
List of items - A section where all different kinds of categories have been listed for the finder to see the items.
